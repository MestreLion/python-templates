- Settings for New Projects is useless for customizing Inspections:
	- New Projects will always have IDE profile by default
	- Changes to IDE Profile can be done from any project
	- Changes to Project Profile will be lost (new Project will have blank default project profile)
	- If Project Profile is renamed, New Project UI will have no Project Profile

- Inspection Profiles:
	- Rename Default IDE PRofile (to Rodrigo IDE), use it only as template for new projects
	- On New Project, Copy IDE Profile to Project Profile and rename it to Project Name (to avoid ambiguity)
	- If some setting is globally useful, add to both profiles

- Spelling:
	- Check "use a single dictionary", keep at "project=level"
	- Keep both [built-in] dicts as is
	- Add words to project dict
	- Adding in Dialog UI *always* add to *project*, regardless of current selection
	- If a global word, switch to "application-level", add (using the Editor), switch back
	- If project-level words dont get saved, delete ./idea/dictonaries so it can be re-created as folder

- More Undos
	- File > Local History is a good alternative
	- Help > Find > Registry
